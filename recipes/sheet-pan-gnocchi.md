### Main

1. First, preheat the oven to 450°F. While it heats up, line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Wash and chop the veggies and fresh herbs.

2. Next, season the gnocchi and veggies. Place the gnocchi, broccolini, tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt, za’atar(or Italian seasoning), thyme leaves, red pepper flakes, and several grinds of pepper. Toss to combine.

3. Then, transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet. Spread everything in a single layer as best you can. The pan will be somewhat crowded, but the better you can space things out, the better they will brown.

4. Roast for 10 minutes. Pull the sheet pan out of the oven and stir the gnocchi and vegetables. Spread them in a single layer again.

5. Before returning the pan to the oven, scatter on the feta. Roast for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until the gnocchi is tender and the veggies and feta are browned.

6. Finally, season to taste and serve with a sprinkle of parsley top!
