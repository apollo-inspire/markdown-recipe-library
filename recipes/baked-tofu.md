Ingredients

14 ounces extra-firm tofu, patted dry and cubed
½ tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons tamari
½ teaspoon sriracha
1 tablespoon cornstarch, optional

Instructions

    Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    Toss the cubed tofu with the olive oil, tamari, and sriracha. For extra crispy tofu, sprinkle with the cornstarch and gently toss to coat.
    Spread the tofu evenly onto the baking sheet. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until browned around the edges. Remove and serve warm.
